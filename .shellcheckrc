# ShellCheck Configuration
# Project: Mobile-Ready Coding Workstation Setup Script

# Shell dialect
shell=bash

# Disable external sources (for security)
external-sources=false

# Severity levels
# error: Issues that are likely to cause bugs or security problems
# warning: Issues that may cause problems but are not critical
# info: Style suggestions and best practices

# Enable all checks by default
# Use # shellcheck disable=SC#### for intentional violations

# Exclusion Rules (FR-016)
# All excluded SC codes must be documented here with justification
# Additional exclusions in source code must include inline comments explaining why

# SC2034: Unused variables
# Justification: Acceptable for future use or readability
# Used for: SCRIPT_NAME, SCRIPT_DIR variables kept for future logging/debugging
# Example: Variables declared but not immediately used (intentional for future features)

# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes
# Justification: Intentional for documentation or when variables need to expand in user's shell, not current shell
# Used for: Documentation strings, heredoc content, or when passing commands to su -c
# Example: su - "$username" -c "export NVM_DIR=\"\$HOME/.nvm\" && ..." (variables expand in user's shell)

# SC1091: External file sourcing
# Justification: Standard system files that are safe to source
# Used for: /etc/os-release (standard system file), configuration files
# Example: . /etc/os-release (standard Debian system file, safe to source)

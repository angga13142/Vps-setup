# Specification Quality Checklist: Terminal Enhancements & UI Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- ✅ All items pass validation (100%)
- ✅ Specification is ready for implementation
- ✅ User stories are prioritized and independently testable
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ Edge cases cover installation failures, conflicts, and environment variations
- ✅ All gaps and ambiguities resolved (see validation-report.md)
- ✅ Measurement methods documented (see docs/measurement-methods.md)
- ✅ Non-functional requirements defined
- ✅ Rollback procedures specified

**Status**: ✅ **VALIDATED** - All requirements quality checks pass. Ready for implementation.
